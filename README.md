# Project Title - HackerEarth:Customer Segmentation

## Customer Segmentation vs Marketing Campaign

Customer segmentation is a process to dividing customers into groups which possess common characteristics based on their age, gender, profession as well as interests. By doing so will enable the company to gain insights of customer’s needs or preferences, therefore the company will design a marketing strategy to target the most profitable segments.

Recently, there has been a decline in revenue for the bank and investigation has been carried out to identify the root of the problem. The bank found out that the reduce in revenue is mainly due to decrement of the deposition of money into the bank by the clients. Hence, the bank decided to conduct marketing campaigns to persuade more clients to deposit money into the bank.
